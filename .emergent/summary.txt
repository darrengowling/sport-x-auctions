The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack fantasy cricket auction application, Sport X Pro Cricket Auctions, from inception. Key development phases included setting up the frontend MVP with React, integrating the backend with FastAPI and MongoDB, and extensive debugging. Core features implemented are a persistent splash page, dynamic navigation, and resolution of persistent player image display issues through a shift to direct image URLs. Crucially, a How it Works page with a flow diagram was introduced. A comprehensive user authentication system, supporting email/password, social, phone, and guest modes, was integrated. The application also gained real-time bidding functionality with fixed increments, live timers, participant tracking, bid history, and live chat. Significant effort was placed on enhancing mobile responsiveness across the entire application and fixing numerous navigation and styling issues. The final ongoing task involves ensuring all Get Started steps and other buttons throughout the app link to their correct destinations.

The goal was to clone  into Sport X Pro Cricket Auctions, emphasizing strategy over gambling. The application needed real-time player auctions, team management, private leagues, player profiles, social interactions, and live updates.
Initial requirements:
- Frontend MVP with mock data.
- Persistent splash page conveying brand values (Sports gaming with friends. No gambling. All game), accessible via navigation, until user interaction.
- Functional navigation.
- Correct display of dynamic content, specifically player images (initially Virat Kohli's headshot).

Subsequent requirements:
- **How it Works page**: Insert between splash and home pages, simple, straightforward, with flow diagram, using provided text (bid for ownership, peer-to-peer, scoring, custom tournaments, live updates, community focus, for fun/cash/charity).
- **User Authentication**: Comprehensive system with email/password, social (Google, Facebook, Apple), phone number, and guest mode options.
- **Real-time Bidding**: Fixed £1M bid increments, all values in £, minimum bid is current bid + £1M, maximum bid is remaining budget, no auto-bids, 10-second bid timer, 1-minute total auction time per player, real-time countdown, instant updates, show auction room participants, bid history, visual alerts for new bids, quick bid buttons, live chat, live stats/info during bidding.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize the entire app for mobile devices.
- **Bug Fixes/Enhancements**:
    - Click-throughs to new pages load at the top.
    - Budget utilization % bar flows off-screen.
    - Hot players button does not link anywhere.
    - Join auction button does not link anywhere.
    - View auctions and join auctions are empty.
    - Create league button doesn't work.
    - Under Your Teams, change headers from black to white.
    - User cannot navigate away from sign-in page without entering details.
    - Remove repetitive Welcome back, cricket fan banner on home page.
    - Featured players button and auctions buttons still leading nowhere.
    - Font color under team performance unreadable.
    - Font color on leagues page unreadable.
    - Get Started steps link through the app, and all buttons take users to required destinations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a final round of navigation fixes and enhancements. The user requested to make the get started steps link through the app and make sure all buttons in the app take the users to the required destination.

In response, the AI engineer made an initial edit, indicating work began on this task. The very last action recorded is the AI engineer stating, Now let me create a comprehensive button audit and fix navigation across all pages. This indicates the current work involves systematically going through the application to ensure every clickable element, especially those related to Get Started steps and other navigation buttons, correctly navigates the user to the intended page or functionality. This is a continuation of the previous rounds of navigation and linking fixes.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Conduct a comprehensive audit of all buttons and Get Started steps to ensure correct navigation throughout the application.
