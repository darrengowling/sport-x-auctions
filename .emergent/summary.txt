The AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack fantasy cricket auction application, initially replicating  and rebranding it as Sports X, which later became Sport X Pro Cricket Auctions to emphasize strategy. The development began with a frontend MVP using mock data, followed by backend integration with FastAPI and MongoDB. A significant challenge was extensive debugging of frontend compilation issues and backend import errors. A core feature implemented was a splash page, which underwent multiple iterations to ensure persistence until user interaction and accessibility via navigation. The AI meticulously addressed issues like auto-redirection and navigation links. Most recently, the engineer tackled a critical bug where Virat Kohli's player image failed to display. This involved attempts to embed base64 images into backend seeding and frontend mock data, encountering difficulties with large string handling and database re-seeding. Despite initial reports of success, the user confirmed the image was still missing, leading the AI to decide on replacing the player with a simpler image solution. The current work involves updating player data to resolve this persistent image display issue.

The primary objective was to clone  into a full-stack mobile application, branded Sports X, then Sport X Pro Cricket Auctions to emphasize strategy over gambling. Key features included real-time player auctions, team management, private leagues, player profiles with detailed stats, social interactions, and live updates. Development started with a frontend MVP using mock data. A crucial addition was a splash page conveying brand values (Sports gaming with friends. No gambling. All game), which needed to persist until user interaction (sign-in/create account) and be permanently accessible. Subsequent requirements focused on fixing navigation and ensuring all dynamic content, like player images, rendered correctly. The application currently has a persistent splash page and functional navigation, but a recent issue involves a missing player image (Virat Kohli) despite attempts to fix it with base64 encoding.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **UI/Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI.
- **Data Management**: React's , , Pydantic for backend models,  for MongoDB.
- **Networking**: Axios for API calls.
- **Routing**: React Router DOM.
- **Deployment**: Supervisor, Kubernetes Ingress.
- **Image Handling**: Base64 encoding.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure with  and  directories.



-   : Main entry point for the React application, configures React Router DOM for navigation.
    -   *Changes*: Routing adjusted to handle  and later  as the root route. Reduced a 1-second loading time that was potentially confused with auto-redirect.
-   : The splash screen displaying brand messaging and values.
    -   *Changes*: Modified to persist until user interaction (click Enter the Arena, Sign In, Create Account) and removed  usage to ensure it appears every time.
-   : A component to manage the first-time display logic for the splash page.
    -   *Changes*: Created to handle conditional rendering, likely deprecated or modified as  became a permanent route.
-   : Contains the primary navigation elements for the app.
    -   *Changes*: Moved from bottom to top. The Sport X brand link was made more prominent and configured to navigate back to the splash page.
-   : Contains static, hardcoded data for initial frontend development.
    -   *Changes*: Initially updated to include a  for Virat Kohli. Most recently, it was updated to change the player data (from Virat Kohli) to resolve persistent image display issues.
-   : Main FastAPI application, handles routing, middleware, and database connection.
    -   *Changes*: Modified to include  with  prefix, integrated new API routes, and database seeding logic. Updated to import and use a new  module for player data, attempting to embed base64 images.
-   : **New file created**. Houses player data including a large base64 image string.
    -   *Changes*: Created to centralize player data and manage the large base64 image string, which was previously causing truncation issues when embedded directly in .

<pending_tasks>
- The player image (initially Virat Kohli's, now a replacement) is still not appearing correctly in the application despite multiple attempts to fix it.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on fixing the critical issue of the disappearing player image. Specifically, after multiple failed attempts to display Virat Kohli's image using base64 encoding (due to issues like string truncation in  and persistent re-seeding problems), the user explicitly instructed the AI to chose a different player or image if the current approach wasn't working.

In response, the AI engineer made the following recent changes:
- **Modified  (Chat Message 119)**: The  file was edited to update the first player's data (originally Virat Kohli's) to use a different player. The provided snippet shows a generic player with  image data, indicating a shift to a simpler, potentially more reliable base64 image.

The work is focused on abandoning the problematic Virat Kohli image and ensuring *any* player image displays correctly by using a different, simpler approach to embed image data. The previous attempts involved creating  for base64 images and clearing/restarting the database repeatedly, but these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful in resolving the frontend display. The current action is a direct response to user feedback, opting for a functional replacement.

Clear the database and restart the backend service to reseed it with the updated player data from .
